	abstract = {Computer-based recording of live presentations has become a widespread way of producing content material for e-learning in both higher education institutions and companies. The success of e-learning projects crucially depends on the acceptance by the end-users working with these materials, i.e., learners but also administrators. From their point of view, the choice of formats used for distribution is a crucial issue, regarding network delivery and Web-based replay. We present the key factors from the end-user's perspective and discuss a number of widespread and standard formats with respect to their suitability for today's Web-based e-learning.},

	abstract = {There are many interface schemes that allow users to work at, and move between, focused and contextual views of a dataset. We review and categorize these schemes according to the interface mechanisms used to separate and blend views. The four approaches are overview+detail, which uses a spatial separation between focused and contextual views; zooming, which uses a temporal separation; focus+context, which minimizes the seam between views by displaying the focus within the context; and cue-based techniques which selectively highlight or suppress items within the information space. Critical features of these categories, and empirical evidence of their success, are discussed. The aim is to provide a succinct summary of the state-of-the-art, to illuminate both successful and unsuccessful interface strategies, and to identify potentially fruitful areas for further work.},

	abstract = {{"Deep} thinking is rare in this field where most companies are glad to copy designs that were great back in the 1970s. The Humane Interface is a gourmet dish from a master chef. Five mice!" {–Jakob} Nielsen, Nielsen Norman Group Author of Designing Web Usability: The Practice of {SimplicityThis} unique guide to interactive system design reflects the experience and vision of Jef Raskin, the creator of the Apple Macintosh. Other books may show how to use today's widgets and interface ideas effectively. Raskin, however, demonstrates that many current interface paradigms are dead ends, and that to make computers significantly easier to use requires new approaches. He explains how to effect desperately needed changes, offering a wealth of innovative and specific interface ideas for software designers, developers, and product {managers.The} Apple Macintosh helped to introduce a previous revolution in computer interface design, drawing on the best available technology to establish many of the interface techniques and methods now universal in the computer industry. With this book, Raskin proves again both his farsightedness and his practicality. He also demonstrates how design ideas must be built on a scientific basis, presenting just enough cognitive psychology to link the interface of the future to the experimental evidence and to show why that interface will {work.Raskin} observes that our honeymoon with digital technology is over: We are tired of having to learn huge, arcane programs to do even the simplest of tasks; we have had our fill of crashing computers; and we are fatigued by the continual pressure to upgrade. The Humane Interface delivers a way for computers, information appliances, and other technology-driven products to continue to advance in power and expand their range of applicability, while becoming free of the hassles and obscurities that plague present products. {0201379376B07092001}},

	abstract = {Practices supporting Web accessibility are spread out all over the world. However, the accessibility of multimedia content
and rich Internet applications has been little discussed. These types of content are using a lot of visual cues and developing
new techniques to make their visual interfaces richer. Therefore, it is generally believed that they are not accessible for
people with visually disabilities. However, since there is neither objective data nor tools to measure the accessibility of
such content, as a first step to tackle these new accessibility issues we focused on the Flash content. A survey was conducted
using five metrics based on the problems faced by screen reader users. We developed a survey tool to assess their severity.
Our results showed a complete lack of alternative texts from the developers in the sampled pages. Also, more than half of
tested pages were hidden to screen reader users. We conclude that most of existing Flash content is not accessible and there
is an emerging need to encourage the use of practices that make Flash content accessible.},

We conducted a study in situ to investigate the accessibility of the web as experienced by web users. This remote study used an advanced web proxy that leverages {AJAX} technology to record both the pages viewed and the actions taken by users on the web pages that they visited. Our study was conducted remotely over the period of one week, and our participants used the assistive technology and software to which they were already accustomed and had already configured according to preference. These advantages allowed us to aggregate observations of many users and to explore the practical effects on and coping strategies employed by our blind participants. Our study reflects web accessibility from the perspective of web users and describes quantitative differences in the browsing behavior of blind and sighted web users.},
